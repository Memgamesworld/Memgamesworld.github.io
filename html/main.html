                    <h1> Mental games </h1>
                    <p>Mental Game refers to the mental state of a player when playing poker. Having a good mental game means that we are psychologically strong and can continue to perform at a high level despite dealing with adversity. Players with a strong
                        mental game go on tilt less and are not as heavily affected by downswings. Many professional players dedicate time to specifically working on their mental game, even hiring a mental game coach in some circumstances.

                    <p>A battle royale game is an online multiplayer video game genre that blends last-man-standing gameplay with the survival, exploration and scavenging elements of a survival game. Battle royale games involve dozens to hundreds of players,
                        who start with minimal equipment and then must eliminate all other opponents while avoiding being trapped outside of a shrinking "safe area " or "safe zone ", with the winner being the last player or team alive.</p>

                    <p>First-person shooter (FPS) is a sub-genre of shooter video games centered on gun and other weapon-based combat in a first-person perspective, with the player experiencing the action through the eyes of the protagonist and controlling

                <p>A horror game is typically a video game designed to scare its player through a variety of techniques. Unlike most video game genres, though, the horror game genre is not based on gameplay elements, but rather the result of playing the
